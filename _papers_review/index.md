Recently I was working as a ML engineer at <a href="https://www.awakeai.ca/about">AwakeAI</a> where I built a real-time video understanding model based on  <a href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/v-jepa-yann-lecun-ai-model-video-joint-embedding-predictive-architecture/">V-JEPA</a>. Previously, after graduating from <a href="https://mila.quebec/en/">Mila</a> I worked in various research projects focused on improving LLMs for coding tasks.

My current goal is to apply deep learning to solve meaningful problems while increasing my expertise.

I am currently working on LLM agents for machine translation at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/alexatranslations/">Alexa Translations</a>. Prior to this, I was working as a ML engineer at <a href="https://www.awakeai.ca/">AwakeAI</a>, where I built a real-time video understanding system based on <a href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/v-jepa-yann-lecun-ai-model-video-joint-embedding-predictive-architecture/">V-JEPA</a> architecture. Before this after graduating from <a href="https://mila.quebec/en/">Mila</a>, I worked on several research initiatives focused on enhancing LLMs for code generation.

I am particularly interested in the prospect of extending the capabilities of monolithic LLMs to autonomous agents that can <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629">act</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10601">reason</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11366">self-correct</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629">select goals</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04761"> use tools</a>.

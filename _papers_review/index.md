I recently completed my master's degree at <a href="https://mila.quebec/en/">Mila</a> and am currently enrolled in various research projects.
 

My current goal is to advance my expertise in machine learning engineering. I believe that the ability to apply cutting-edge deep learning research will play a pivotal role in the forthcoming technological revolution and that is what I am focusing on currently.

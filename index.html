      <p>I’m a research master’s student at the <a href="https://www.umontreal.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">University of Montreal</a> under the supervision of
 <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xsUkTCEAAAAJ&amp;hl=fr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prof. Houari Sahraoui</a>, currently working on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_based_model" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">energy-based models</a>.</p>

<p>My main research goal is to investigate how the process of inference, both in biological brains and artificial intelligence systems, gives rise to complex hierarchical beliefs about the world. By gaining insights into this process, my aim is to advance the development of more sophisticated intelligent machines and deepen our understanding of brain functions.</p>

<p>Although this is my main long-term research goal, I am very interested in all fields related to this idea, especially deep learning, reinforcement learning, robotics, brain-computer interface, and computational neuroscience. During my master’s degree at the University of Montreal I took all my courses  at <a href="https://mila.quebec/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mila</a> and became teacher assistant for Mila’s <a href="https://neo-x.github.io/teaching/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">robot learning class</a> , meanwhile I’ve received a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_Sciences_and_Engineering_Research_Council" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NSERC</a> grant to research and develop new methods in deep learning.</p>

<p>Below I detail  the research directions I am considering working on in the future. Please feel free to <a href="mailto:atonkamanda@hotmail.com">contact me</a> if you are interested in collaborating.</p>

<strong>Research</strong> directions</h1>



  <p><strong>Using latent variable models to build machines with common sense and a complex set of beliefs.</strong></p>
   <ul style="list-style: disc;">
  <li> Humans and animals learn most of their basic knowledge about how the world works in their childhood. A good example of this is the perception that the world is three-dimensional. The brain has no direct access to the 3D structure of
    any perceived object. In contrast, it receives low-level 2D sensory information from the retina and 3D is the best way for our brain to explain how our view of the
    world changes from our left eye to our right eye, or when our head is being moved. This phenomenon is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconscious_inference" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">unconscious inference</a>, is fundamental to cognition and is well captured by latent variable models such as VAE or energy-based models.</li>



  <br>

  <li> An important corollary of that is the fact that we don't directly perceive the world around us rather our brains are inference engines whose function is to infer the probable causes of sensory inputs. Those probable causes can be high dimensional, are learned by optimization, and are analogous to beliefs about the world being modeled, they are the system's best guesses on the latent variables which explain the data.  </li>

  <br>
  

  <li>I share <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=BZ5a1r-kVsf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yann Lecun's view </a> that common sense can be seen as a hierarchical model of the world that can tell an agent what is likely, what is plausible, and what is impossible about high dimensional representations, and would emerge given that the agent has sufficiently good data, inductive biases, and optimization process. Energy-based models have a lot of properties that make them a perfect candidate for this.</li>


  




</ul>


<p><strong>Using deep learning to build mechanistic models of cognition.</strong></p>

<ul style="list-style: disc;">
  <li>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_energy_principle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The free energy principle </a> is the most convincing and successful theory of cognition, it is very powerful in that it doesn't only try to explain what cognition is, it explains the mathematical rules that any agent doted with cognition should follow in any possible world. If we assume that it is right then the brain can be viewed as a particular solution nature found to implement approximate bayesian inference in biological organisms and AI research can be viewed as finding the best ways to implement it into machines. </li>

  <br>

  <li> Under this account it is not surprising that deep learning models <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-019-0520-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">are becoming the best tools to model the neuronal response and behavior of some parts of the brain</a>, and that they develop similar features to those of humans and animals when trained on the same task such as <a href="https://distill.pub/2020/circuits/early-vision/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gabor filters</a>. With enough optimization and architectural similarity to bias the hypotheses space they discover the same best explanations for the data. It gets
    physically instantiate in the neural activation vectors of brains and machines and make the apperance of things like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandmother_cell" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">grandmother cells</a> obvious. </li>
  <br>

  <li>A lot of complex mental phenomena previously thought to be mysterious make a lot more sense under this paradigm, such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01791" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">perception and action</a>, <a href="https://grazianolab.princeton.edu/sites/g/files/toruqf3411/files/graziano/files/jcs_graziano_2016.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">consciousness</a>, its <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.06403.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ineffability</a>, <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=BZ5a1r-kVsf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">emotions</a>, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.07408.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">selfhood</a>, or mental disorders such as <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn2536" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">schizophrenia</a>, <a href="https://www.quentinhuys.com/pub/HuysEa14-VulnerabilityAddictionDopamine.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">addiction</a>, and maybe even <a href="https://www.deepmind.com/blog/dopamine-and-temporal-difference-learning-a-fruitful-relationship-between-neuroscience-and-ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">depression</a>. </li>
  <br>

  <li>What I explain above also mean that what is left for AI and neuroscience is not to find new theories about what cognition and intelligence are but rather find how precisely those computations are implemented in the brain and how we can implement them into machines. It is therefore becoming more and more relevant to study artificial agents with tools inspired by psychology and neuroscience to probe their set of beliefs about the world and how they evolve with learning, for example recently a lot of benchmarks have appeared based on the violation of expectation paradigm to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-022-01394-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">test for the model understanding of intuitive physics</a>, on a more mechanistic ground <a href="https://distill.pub/2020/circuits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">circuits</a> use a broad set of tools to gain insight into the computations performed by a single neural network, I think this type of works are going in the right direction. </li>
